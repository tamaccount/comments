# Comments UI Implementation

## Project Overview

This repository showcases my implementation of a UI component that visualizes a comments feature for web applications. I created a pixel-perfect translation of the design into a functional, accessible, and performant component using Next.js.

### Live Demo & Design Source
- **Live Demo**: [View the live implementation](https://comments-ivory-six.vercel.app)
- **Figma Design**: [View the original design](https://www.figma.com/design/EfGAbjGbcbcZY5MnLTdrae/Comments-UI?node-id=0-1&t=MqXtG1hauu3HZ21N-1)

### What I Built
In this project, I:
- Translated a detailed Figma mockup into responsive, functional code
- Implemented animated cursors with floating animations
- Created an interactive dropdown menu for comment actions
- Ensured accessibility and performance optimization
- Wrote clean, maintainable code using reusable React components

## Assignment Details

This project is based on a practice exercise to build a UI component visualizing a comments feature. The starter repository included:

- A barebones Next.js application
- Tailwind or CSS Modules for styling options
- Color tokens matching the Figma design

See the [PROJECT_DETAILS.md](./PROJECT_DETAILS.md) file for more specific implementation requirements.
