# Project Details: Comments UI

## The Concept

This project focuses on building a visual representation of a comments feature for websites. The goal is to create a section that effectively conveys how users can leave contextual comments on website previews.

## Design Requirements

Based on the provided Figma design, the implementation should create reusable React components that render semantic markup. You may follow the layer naming conventions established in Figma or develop your own organization system.

## Specific Implementation Notes

The designer provided these specific implementation details:

- "The cursors should have an infinite floating animation. You may choose your timings, movement, and any other polish you feel inclined to add."
- "Clicking the â‹¯ icon in the first comment should expand a list of user actions, as detailed in the design. Feel free to design the interaction as you see fit."

## Focus Areas

When working on this implementation, focus on these key aspects:

- **Precision**: How closely does your implementation match the design?
- **Handling Ambiguities**: How do you approach areas where interaction, animation, or other specs are not fully defined?
- **Delight**: What creative liberties can you take to make this component more fun or memorable?
- **Invisible Qualities**: Consider aspects such as accessibility, performance, and the reusability of your code for future collaborators.

## Technical Constraints

While UI component libraries like shadcn and Radix would typically be helpful, this project encourages a DIY approach to demonstrate fundamental implementation skills. Animation libraries such as Framer Motion are allowed but not required. The project can be completed without any additional external dependencies.
